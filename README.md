Vehicle Dynamics and Kinematics Simulation Files

I can say that my knowledge with 3 years into mechanical engineering and joining the team in 2019 my engineering skills that the fewer moving parts, the better the chassis FEA. Our work does not only involve the structural integrity of the car but also the seamless integration of all the components of the car such as the aeroshell and steering system of the car. If I'm not working on the car I'm probably designing robots or in the gym.

I am a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student in the general engineering stream and a co-lead of the Vehicle Dynamics sub-team.

At Vehicle Dynamics, our team works to optimize the behaviour and manufacturability of the suspension, handling, wheels, and braking apects of the car.
