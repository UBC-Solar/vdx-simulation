## Hardpoint Forces
Run `mainHardpointForces.m` to obtain current hardpoint forces based on geomerty pulled from SW Hardpoints on V4 Vehicle Dynamics google sheet.
Note, the main script is dependent on the other .m files in this folder. Try to use Munro's Matlab startup utility. In a pinch, download all the .m files that are referenced in the main script and have them in your working folder with the main script.
