## Hardpoint Forces
Run `mainHardpointForces.m` to obtain the current hardpoint forces based on the geometry pulled from SW Hardpoints on [V4 Vehicle Dynamics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C9o_FGi18w9rInHHT_hzzjyN-1102uIo5yY6cqIHfXk/edit?gid=1104959099#gid=1104959099) Google sheet.
Note, the main script is dependent on the other .m files in this folder. Try using Munro's MATLAB startup utility. In a pinch, download all the .m files that are referenced in the main script and have them in your working folder with the main script.
